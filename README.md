This fork of `paradoxxxzero/gnome-shell-system-monitor-applet` is for
packaging purposes only. This fork contains Github Actions workflows
([here](.github/workflows)) to continuously sync against the upstream
`master` branch and upload the resulting build to extensions.gnome.org
([system-monitor-next](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3010/system-monitor-next/)).

Any issues, bug reports, feature requests, etc. for the extension itself
should be submitted to the [upstream
repo](https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/gnome-shell-system-monitor-applet),
but build/sync issues should be reported here.

The approach in this repo is preferable for users on bleeding edge
distributions who prefer not to wait for a stable release from the main
repo. Of course, since we're releasing directly from `master` some
instability is inevitable.

### Installation

#### Prerequisites

This extension [requires GNOME Shell v3.26 or later](https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/gnome-shell-system-monitor-applet/blob/master/system-monitor%40paradoxxx.zero.gmail.com/metadata.json#L2).

Before installing this extension, ensure you have the necessary system packages installed:

* On Ubuntu:

      sudo apt install gir1.2-gtop-2.0 gir1.2-nm-1.0 gir1.2-clutter-1.0 gnome-system-monitor

* On Debian:

      sudo apt install gir1.2-gtop-2.0 gir1.2-nm-1.0 gir1.2-clutter-1.0 gnome-system-monitor

* On Fedora:

      sudo dnf install libgtop2-devel NetworkManager-libnm-devel gnome-system-monitor

* On Arch Linux:

      sudo pacman -S libgtop networkmanager gnome-system-monitor clutter

* On openSUSE (Leap 42.1):

      sudo zypper install gnome-shell-devel libgtop-devel libgtop-2_0-10 gnome-system-monitor

* On Mageia 64-bit (just remove "64" on i586):

      sudo urpmi lib64gtop-gir2.0 lib64nm-gir1.0 lib64clutter-gir1.0 gnome-system-monitor

    or

      sudo dnf install lib64gtop-gir2.0 lib64nm-gir1.0 lib64clutter-gir1.0 gnome-system-monitor


Additionally, if you have an NVIDIA graphics card, and want to monitor its memory usage, you'll need to install `nvidia-smi`.

For the browser installation (recommended), you will need the GNOME Shell integration browser extension for
[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gnome-shell-integration/gphhapmejobijbbhgpjhcjognlahblep),
[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gnome-shell-integration/) or
[Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/gnome-shell-integration/).

Note: If you're using Firefox 52 or later, [you will also need to install `chrome-gnome-shell`](https://blogs.gnome.org/ne0sight/2016/12/25/how-to-install-gnome-shell-extensions-with-firefox-52/).
The instructions are available [on the GNOME wiki](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeShellIntegrationForChrome/Installation#Ubuntu_Linux).

#### Browser installation

It's recommended you install the extension via the Gnome Shell Extensions website.

Visit [this extension's page on extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/120/system-monitor/),
preferably in Firefox, and install by clicking the toggle button next to the extension's name.

If the install was successful, the toggle button should now show "ON".
If it failed, ensure that you installed all the [necessary dependencies](#prerequisites),
and that you granted the browser permission to install extensions when prompted.
Additionally, rebooting gnome-shell may help (type `Alt + F2` and input `r` in the prompt), but it won't work with Wayland.

#### Repository installation

* Extension is in Fedora onwards (up to Fedora 33, last update) and Rawhide repositories, you can install it for all users with the following command:

      sudo dnf install gnome-shell-extension-system-monitor-applet

* Enable it with `gnome-tweak-tool` or `gnome-shell-extension-tool --enable-extension=system-monitor@paradoxxx.zero.gmail.com`

#### Manual installation

To install the extension from source, clone this repo and create the
appropriate symlink in the Gnome Shell extensions directory like so:

    cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
    ln -sv /path/to/gnome-shell-system-monitor-applet/system-monitor@paradoxxx.zero.gmail.com/

Then enable the extension:

    gnome-extensions enable system-monitor-next@paradoxxx.zero.gmail.com

To load the extension, reload your Gnome Shell session. If using X11, press
`Alt + F2`, then `r`. If using Wayland, you'll need to logout/login.

If you're going to be doing development/testing under Wayland and don't
want to keep logging out/in you can use Gnome Shell's support for [nested
sessions under
Wayland](https://gjs.guide/extensions/development/creating.html#wayland-sessions). To
start a nested session, run:

    dbus-run-session -- gnome-shell --nested --wayland

then start a new terminal *inside* the nested session (it will show up
outside of the nested window, but don't panic; the dbus session address
will be configured to point at the nested session), and run the above
`gnome-extensions enable` command in your new terminal. You may also need
to enable extensions using the Gnome Extensions app inside your nested
session.

#### Translation

If we do not have the translation for your language and you want to translate it by yourself, please make a fork, add your `po/<YOUR_LANG>/system-monitor-applet.po` file, and make a pull request.

#### Deployment
    
1. To create a ZIP file with the specified version number, ready to upload to [GNOME Shell Extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/) or similar repository, run:

    make zip-file VERSION=<version>

To determine the version number to use, check the extensions site and increment from the largest published version.

The specified version number is just for documentation and isn't strictly necessary in the uploaded file, since the extensions website will dynamically set this and override whatever we enter.

2. Once uploaded, [create a GitHub release](https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/gnome-shell-system-monitor-applet/releases) with the same version number.
