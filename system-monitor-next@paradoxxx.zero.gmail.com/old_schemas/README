LOOK AWAY!!!

This is the old gsettings schema definition (source and compiled). The
reason it's here is because we had to rename our extension schema ID to
avoid clashing with other extensions (see #65). Unfortunately, moving to a
new schema ID will result in losing all settings under the old schema
ID. We'd like to support migrating old settings to the new schema ID
(without user intervention) and it appears that the best way to do it is by
having the old schema available at runtime. We also explored a dconf
solution but it got really ugly in the code, and asking users to run `dconf
dump | dconf load` is not ideal.

Having fun yet?
