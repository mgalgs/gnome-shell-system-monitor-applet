This extension is built and updated continuously with the upstream master branch.\n\nThis is preferable for users on bleeding edge distributions that prefer not to wait for a stable release from the main repo. Of course, since we're releasing directly from master some instability is inevitable.\n\nIf you get an error after updating, try restarting Gnome Shell with Alt-F2 then 'r'.",
